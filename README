pdfgrep
=======
PDFgrep takes a PDF and regular expression as input and tries to locate a match
within the PDF.  If a match is found, the page number from which it occurs is
reported to the user.


libnachopdf
===========
libnachopdf (Not 'yo PDF) is a library for extracting text from a PDF.  This
library is quite limited and incomplete.  Currently it can decompress
FlateDecode (zlib) text streams and it has a basic PS interpreter to decode text
from PS encoded streams.


Caveat/Warning
==============
Unfortunately the detection of spacing between words is lacking in libnachopdf.
Therefore, since pdfgrep is based on this library spaces are ignored.  Hey, it's
a work in progress.


Building
========
Building is simple (no config is provided), just run the following:
>     make pdfgrep

If you just want to build the library:
>     make libnachopdf


Installing
==========
This project is still alpha, build and then copy the binary (and or library)
whereever you wish.
